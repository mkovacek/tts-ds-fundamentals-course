# Hi, sry for this weird way of being contacted. Wasn't able to find any other way.

I'm planning to open a new GitHub Organization named Smitheo, but unfortunately, this name is already taken by your account. 
Any chance that you can rename your username account if it is not important to you? This would mean a lot of to us.
